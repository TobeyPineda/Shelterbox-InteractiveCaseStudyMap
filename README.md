### About Shelterbox:
Since 2000, ShelterBox has helped 1.7 million people by providing emergency shelter following more than 300 disasters in 95 countries.

ShelterBox responds urgently to earthquake, volcano, flood, hurricane, cyclone, tsunami, or conflict by delivering emergency shelter and other aid, including blankets, water filter and carriers, solar lights, and other essential tools for survival.

#### Case Studies:
Case Studies are ShelterBox's way of documenting the stories and struggles of people who are affected by natural disasters or conflict. This typically includes a personal story and photos of the people and their current living situation.

### About the Project:
ShelterBox wants a deliverable that will not only attract more users but also retain the existing donors and encourage younger generations to start gaining interest. We aimed to improve the overall experience and visuals designs of the map to make the first impression appealing to first time visitors while also offering a seamless experience. Furthermore, we wanted to demonstrate the impact Shelterbox has had on communities throughout the world, so that it would resonate with users. Lastly, the workflow to add features and update data is significantly simplified by utilizing only Google Spreadsheets and basic web development languages
